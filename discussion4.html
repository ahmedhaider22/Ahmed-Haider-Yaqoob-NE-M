  1- Not recommended to use tables for HTML layout, why?
 -->

  <!-- 
  answar :
It is not recommended to use tables for HTML layout as it can lead to semantic and accessibility problems.
 Tables were originally intended for data, not layout, and their misuse can cause confusion for users who depend 
 on assistive technologies. Additionally, tables can present difficulties for responsive design and may negatively 
 affect performance. For more efficient, maintainable, and cleaner web development, modern layout techniques like Flexbox
  that employ CSS are preferred.
 -->



  <!--  
2- Rewrite the above code in the “2. Procedure section” using semantic elements and attributes but 
without using the tables and CSS.
